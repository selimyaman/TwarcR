# TwarcR
This package is still under construction. Mainly functions for some personal research use. That can change over time, though. We'll see.

It basically does some data wrangling for twitter datasets downloaded via twarc2.

There is no warranty of the package or whatsoever. Free to use. Just please cite me if you use it.

You can install this library by:

``` r
devtools::install_github("selimyaman/TwarcR")
```
